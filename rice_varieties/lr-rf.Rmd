## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(randomForest)
```

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r}
train <- read.csv("rice_train.csv") 
```

```{r}
test <- read.csv("rice_test.csv")
```

```{r}
# Convert Class variable to factor
train$Class <- factor(train$Class)
```


```{r}
# Train a Random Forest classification model
rf_model <- randomForest(Class ~ ., data = train, ntree = 100)
```

```{r}
# Extract feature importance
importance(rf_model)
```

```{r}
summary(train)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
# Visualize feature importance
varImpPlot(rf_model)
```

```{r}
glm.fits = glm(Class~ Major_Axis_Length + Perimeter + Convex_Area + Eccentricity + Minor_Axis_Length + Extent , data = train , family = binomial)
```

```{r}
predictions <- predict(glm.fits, newdata = test[, c("Major_Axis_Length", "Perimeter", "Convex_Area", "Eccentricity", "Minor_Axis_Length" , "Extent")], type = "response")
```

```{r}
# Convert probabilities to predicted classes (0 or 1)
predicted_classes <- ifelse(predictions > 0.5, 2, 1)
```

```{r}
str(predicted_classes)
```

```{r}
write.table(file="4thSubmission.txt", predicted_classes, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
